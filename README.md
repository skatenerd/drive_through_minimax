# minimax

TEST DRIVE YOUR WAY THROUGH MINIMAX

Each test provides you with a game tree and a function for scoring leaf nodes.

The game tree is actually supposed to LOOK LIKE A TREE, to help you visualize the algorithm.

## Usage
```
lein deps
lein spec -a
```
Then make the tests pass.  Then email me so I can see what you did.
